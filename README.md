# ml-project-1-krz

Project 1 for the EPFL ML course.

## Team
- Rhita Mamou ([@rhitamam](https://github.com/rhitamam))
- Zied Mustapha ([@Laniakea1999](https://github.com/Laniakea1999))
- Kepler Warrington-Arroyo ([@bitshrine](https://github.com/bitshrine))

## Scripts:

> Note: our scripts assume that there is a `data` directory at the root of the project containing two uncompressed files: `test.csv` and `train.csv`.

- [**exploration.ipynb**](scripts/exploration.ipynb): Contains most of the code along with all data visualization methods.
- [**run.py**](scripts/run.py): Run this file to generate our best prediction.
- [**implementations.py**](scripts/implementations.py): The 6 methods to implement.
- [**model_imp.py**](scripts/model_imp.py): Helper functions for our custom model implementation.
- [**helpers.py**](scripts/helpers.py), [**plots.py**](scripts/plots.py), [**proj1_helpers.py**](scripts/proj1_helpers.py): Helper functions to generate prediction and visualize code (not implemented by us)

## Report:
Our report can be found in [report/report-krz.pdf](report/report-krz.pdf).

## Output:

[**prediction.csv**](output/prediction): the final prediction
